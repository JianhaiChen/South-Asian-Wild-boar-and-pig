At 10 years ago (2014), I proposed the project of "The genomic profile for South Asian wild boar and domestic pigs' and got supports from my supervisor Dr. Shuhong Zhao. 

Then I received great academic input from Dr. Jianlin Han. 

In 2024, this project has almost complete. We found the 'Out of South Asia' migration for global wild boar populations, which is different from the long-acknowledged origination history for wild boar [1,2].

Current title of our Manuscript: 'Out of South Aisa' migration of global wild boar: distinctive genomic profile of wild boar and domestic pig populations in South Asia

Welcome to the South-Asian-Wild-boar-and-pig research!

The dataset is here:https://zenodo.org/records/10529160



This page includes the primary pipeline for population genomics in South Asian wild boars and domestic pigs.
