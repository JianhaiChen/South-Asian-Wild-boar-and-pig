Ten years ago, in 2014, I decided to initiate a project about "The Genomic analysis of Wild Boar and Domestic Pigs from South Asia and Southeast Asia" to understand wild boar origin and population genetics. 

This endeavor was fortunate to receive significant support from my mentor, Dr. Shuhong Zhao, and invaluable academic insights from Dr. Jianlin Han and all other coauthors.

Now, in 2024, as we near the completion of this project, our findings suggest an alternative possiblity to the traditionally accepted origins of wild boars.


We present evidence supporting an 'Out of South Asia' origin for the global wild boar populations, marking a departure from the long-established historical narrative.


Current title of our Manuscript: 'Out of South Aisa' migration of global wild boar: distinctive genomic profile of wild boar and domestic pig populations in South Asia

Welcome to the South-Asian-Wild-boar-and-pig research!

The dataset is here:https://zenodo.org/records/10529160



This page includes the primary pipeline for population genomics in South Asian wild boars and domestic pigs.
